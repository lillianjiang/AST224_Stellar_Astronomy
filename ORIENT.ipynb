We will be using Python Version 3.7. Python is most easily installed and run through a distribution platform called __[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)__. After installation the **Anaconda Navigator** package will appear on your toolbar, symbolized as a green ring. Upon opening Navigator the *Home* menu appears, with options to launch various packages.

A Notebook combines code, explanatory text, mathematics, output, plots-- all in a single document. It is formatted in blocks called *cells* that can be run one cell at a time or all together. We will be using Jupyter Notebooks for assigments in this class. Notebooks always have extension **.ipynb**. They are described in the following cell.\n",

Executing python commands one line at a time is a great way to see if you have the correct command syntax. Try typing 1+1 on the command line. To exit ipython, type (parentheses included!): **`exit()`** and the \"\\$\" prompt will return. **This mode can be run simultaneously with a Jupyter Notebook**. \n",

    "2. In addition to explanatory text in markup cells, also use comments (\\#) in code cells to clarify what is happening.\n",

    "3. Variable names are case sensitive! Choose variable names that identify its significance, e.g. star, counts, not x, y.  Be sure to create a new variable name for each new quantity you calculate. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Although code cells in Jupyter can be run in any order (hence the sequential number in brackets), plan your notebooks to always execute cells in the order they appear. If you note a mistake in an earlier cell and go back to correct it, be careful to also re-execute any cells that depend on it. If you want to do a calculation similar to one that you executed in a previous cell, copy the contents of that cell into a new cell, rename the variables, make the changes, and execute it.\n",

    "5. Make sure all answers are clearly labeled and easily found. Ditto for graphical output.\n"
